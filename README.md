# Earth Calendar

A circular calendar that shows the Earth's position in its orbit
around the Sun.

## Installation

The calendar is bundled as a WordPress plugin. Install
and activate it like any other plugin.

## Usage

Use the \[earth_calendar\] shortcode on any WordPress
post or page.

## Development

I recommend using [VVV](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/docs/en-US/installation/) for local development.

In that case, you can clone this repository directly into

```
~/vvv-local/www/wordpress-one/public_html/wp-content/plugins
```
